In this box model, the height and width of the box will remain fixed. 
The border thickness and padding will be included inside of the box, which means the overall dimensions of the box do not change.


* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

h1 {
  border: 1px solid black;
  height: 200px;
  width: 300px;
  padding: 10px;
}

In the example above, the height of the box would remain at 200 pixels and the width would remain at 300 pixels. 
The border thickness and padding would remain entirely inside of the box.



In the default box model, box dimensions are affected by border thickness and padding.
The box-sizing property controls the box model used by the browser.
The default value of the box-sizing property is content-box.
The value for the new box model is border-box.
The border-box model is not affected by border thickness or padding.
